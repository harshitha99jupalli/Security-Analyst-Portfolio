# Day 01 — What is Cybersecurity? (Security Analyst / SOC Analyst)

## What is cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity means protecting computers, networks, and data from attacks.

## What does a Security Analyst do?
- Monitors alerts and suspicious activity
- Reviews logs (Windows, Linux, network, email)
- Investigates incidents (phishing, brute force, malware)
- Documents findings and escalates when needed

## Key terms (simple)
- Threat: something that can cause harm (phishing, malware)
- Vulnerability: weakness (misconfig, outdated patch)
- Risk: chance + impact of a threat using a vulnerability
