# CIA Triad

The CIA Triad is the basic idea of information security. 
It helps organizations protect their data and systems.

CIA stands for:
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability


## Confidentiality

Confidentiality means keeping information private.
Only the right people should be able to see the data.

Example:
Bank details, passwords, and personal files should not be visible to everyone.
Only authorized users can access them.


## Integrity

Integrity means keeping data correct and safe from changes.
Information should not be altered without permission.

Example:
If someone changes salary data or exam marks without approval,
it means integrity is broken.


## Availability

Availability means making sure systems and data are always accessible
when users need them.

Example:
If a website goes down because of an attack,
users cannot access it. This is an availability problem.


## Why CIA is Important in Security

The CIA Triad helps companies protect their systems.
It makes sure data is:
- Private
- Accurate
- Always available

If any one part fails, security becomes weak.


## How SOC Analysts Use CIA

SOC analysts use CIA to check security incidents.

They ask questions like:
- Was any private data leaked? (Confidentiality)
- Was any data changed? (Integrity)
- Was the system offline? (Availability)

This helps them understand the impact of an attack.


## Real-Life Example

Example: Online banking system stops working

Confidentiality:
Customer data must stay private even during issues.

Integrity:
Transaction records should not be changed.

Availability:
Customers should be able to access their accounts anytime.
