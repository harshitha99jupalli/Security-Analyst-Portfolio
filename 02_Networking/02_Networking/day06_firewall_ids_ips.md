# Day 06 — Firewalls, IDS, and IPS

## Firewall
A firewall controls network traffic based on rules.
It allows or blocks traffic.

Example:
Block incoming traffic on port 3389.

## IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
IDS monitors network traffic and generates alerts.
It does not block traffic.

Example:
Alert when port scanning is detected.

## IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)
IPS monitors and blocks malicious traffic automatically.

Example:
Block IP after detecting multiple attacks.

## Key Differences
Firewall → Controls access
IDS → Detects threats
IPS → Prevents threats

## Why This Matters
Security analysts monitor IDS/IPS alerts
and review firewall logs to detect attacks.

## My Notes
IDS alerts must be analyzed carefully.
Not all alerts are real attacks.
