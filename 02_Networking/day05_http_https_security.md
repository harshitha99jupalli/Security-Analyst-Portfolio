# Day 05 — HTTP vs HTTPS and Security Risks

## What is HTTP?
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is used to transfer data between browser and server.
It is not encrypted.

## What is HTTPS?
HTTPS is secure HTTP.
It uses TLS encryption to protect data.

## Key Difference
HTTP → Not secure
HTTPS → Encrypted and secure

## Why This Matters in Security
Attackers abuse web traffic by:
- Hosting phishing websites
- Sending malicious download links
- Creating fake login pages
- Using HTTPS to hide malicious activity

## Important Security Checks
- Check domain spelling
- Look at SSL certificate
- Analyze URL parameters
- Check domain reputation

## Example
http://fake-bank-login.com (Phishing)
https://malicious-site.com (Still dangerous even if HTTPS)

## My Notes
HTTPS does not always mean safe.
Security analysts must analyze URLs carefully.
